# Smart Parking Lot System 🚗

A Java-based simulation of a multi-level parking facility logic. This project demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles including Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

## Features
- **Dynamic Spot Allocation:** Algorithms to assign spots based on specific vehicle types (Motorcycle, Car, Truck).
- **Scalable Design:** Modular class structure allowing easy addition of new vehicle types or billing logic.
- **Conflict Handling:** Prevents invalid parking (e.g., Trucks in Compact spots).

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 17
- **Concepts:** OOP, Collections Framework (ArrayList)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the files: `javac ParkingLot.java`
3. Run the simulation: `java ParkingLot`
